# Current Deployment Status

## ✅ What's Working

1. **AWS Infrastructure Deployed**: All resources successfully created
   - DynamoDB Table
   - 4 Lambda Functions
   - API Gateway
   - SQS Queues (with DLQ)
   - SNS Topic
   - Step Functions State Machine
   - CloudWatch Logs & Alarms

2. **Permissions Fixed**: Added CloudWatch PutMetricData permissions to all Lambda functions

3. **API Endpoint Active**: `https://k295kgtlkg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`

4. **API Key Retrieved**: `FeBmxt5AGj1sKt2QElmFz79nbbwcWMVo8pMUwxjD`

## ⚠️ Current Issue

The API is returning `500 Internal Server Error` when creating orders. This needs debugging.

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Option 1: View CloudWatch Logs (AWS Console - Recommended)

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logsV2:log-groups
2. Find log group: `/aws/lambda/chikwex-order-processing-system-order-creation`
3. Click on the latest log stream
4. Look for the Python error/traceback

### Option 2: Test Lambd directly

```bash
cd ChikwexServerlessAssign3
python -m awscli lambda invoke \
  --function-name chikwex-order-processing-system-order-creation \
  --payload '{"body": "{\"customerId\": \"TEST\", \"items\": [{\"productId\": \"P1\", \"quantity\": 1, \"price\": 10}]}"}' \
  response.json

cat response.json
```

### Option 3: Check IAM Permissions

The Lambda function needs these permissions:
- ✅ DynamoDB:PutItem (for saving orders)
- ✅ SQS:SendMessage (for queue)
- ✅ SNS:Publish (for notifications)
- ✅ CloudWatch:PutMetricData (for metrics) - FIXED
- ❓ Check if there are other missing permissions

## 📊 What You've Learned So Far

1. **AWS SAM**: How to build and deploy serverless applications
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: Defined entire stack in template.yaml
3. **Docker Containers**: Used for building Lambda functions
4. **CloudFormation**: Saw resources being created in real-time
5. **IAM Permissions**: Fixed missing CloudWatch permissions
6. **Debugging**: Using CloudWatch Logs to troubleshoot issues

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Debug the Lambda Error**:
   - Check CloudWatch Logs in AWS Console
   - Identify the specific Python error
   - Fix the code or permissions issue

2. **Test the Full Flow**:
   - Create order → should return order ID
   - Get order by ID → should retrieve order
   - List orders → should show all orders
   - Check SQS queue → should see message
   - Check CloudWatch metrics → should see OrdersCreated metric

3. **Monitor in Real-Time**:
   - X-Ray traces for request flow
   - CloudWatch metrics for business intelligence
   - SQS queue depth monitoring

## 💡 Tips

- Use the AWS Console for easier debugging (more user-friendly than CLI)
- CloudWatch Logs show the exact Python error messages
- X-Ray shows the request trace even if it failed
- Don't worry about the error - debugging is part of learning!

## 🔐 Security Reminder

**IMPORTANT**: After completing this tutorial, rotate your AWS credentials:
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/Chikwe
2. Security credentials tab
3. Delete the current access key
4. Create a new one

The credentials in this chat are now exposed and should be rotated for security.

## 📚 What to Submit for Assignment

Even with the current debugging state, you have:
- ✅ Complete SAM template
- ✅ All Lambda functions coded
- ✅ Infrastructure successfully deployed
- ✅ API documentation
- ✅ Architecture diagram
- ✅ Testing documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive README

This demonstrates understanding of serverless architecture!
